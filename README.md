# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-IOT
An irrigation system which is designed to provide continuous supply of water to crops. In this gateway sensor is used to handle sensor information and helps to transmit data to user, Wireless through Zigbee moisture, Humidity and Temperature sensors is programmed with microcontroller based gateway which is used to monitor agriculture area. The proposed system consist of 3sensor nodes of MSP430, each having Temperature, moisture and humidity sensor. These source node are connected to master node through zigbee. The master node is of MSP432 with WiFi enabled so that it will receive data from all sensor nodes, store data on cloud and it will get displayed on smart phone and web portal on PC in tabular and graphical format
